In this project, I created a dataset using OpenCV and haarcascade, employing it for the training and testing phases of the LBPH model. As an innovative addition, I introduced the Vision Transformer model, conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation between these two models. Additionally, I had the opportunity to showcase the intricacies of this project by presenting a detailed conference paper at the esteemed 14th ICCCNT Conference hosted by IIT Delhi.
